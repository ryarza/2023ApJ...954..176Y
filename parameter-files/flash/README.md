This flash.par is a template. The template has invalid values for the following variables, which should be set explicitly before running a simulation:
    - sim_epsilon_grad: dimensionless density gradient
    - sim_radius: ratio between geometrical and gravitational radii
    - sim_q: ratio between companion mass and the mass enclosed by its orbit
    - lrefine_max: maximum refinement level
